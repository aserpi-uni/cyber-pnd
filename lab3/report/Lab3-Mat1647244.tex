    \section{Introduction}
    The private network of \textit{ACME co.} is composed by four subnetworks living in the shared address space \texttt{100.64.0.0/16}. \dmz is connected directly to the main firewall-router \mainfw and offers services accessible from the external network, while \client and \ser networks are behind a second line of defence (represented by the internal firewall-router \intfw). The latter offers services that may be used only by hosts in the private network, whereas the former does not offer any services.
    
    All hosts except the firewalls are already configured.
