    \section{Test of the configuration}
    Testing was performed manually, trying to login in the two firewalls, both in the web GUI and the physical terminal.
    Using the built-in root user had a negative outcome, while using a LDAP account gave access to both the web GUI and the shell.
    
    
    \section{Final remarks}
    \opn has a lacklustre LDAP support.
    
    The primary shortcoming is the manual user configuration: the usefulness of a central domain controller is greatly diminished if admins must import locally and configure new users in each firewall.
    
    Another deficiency is the non-existent group support.
    A sensible approach would be inserting newly-imported users into local groups with the same names as their LDAP groups (optionally creating those which do not exist) in order to ease privilege assignment; instead, LDAP groups are completely ignored.
    
    Lastly, the documentation is not up to date: some icons are different (e.g. the user import icon) and some settings are located in different sections (e.g. the active authentication servers).
