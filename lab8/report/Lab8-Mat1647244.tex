    \section{\sq installation}
    The assignment was carried out in a local environment.
    
    A new \vb guest running Arch Linux was created.
    Since the configuration was conducted through terminal commands, no graphical interface was added.
    Squid was installed using the default package manager (\mintinline{sh}{pacman -S squid}) and started at boot time through \textit{systemd} (\mintinline{sh}{systemctl enable squid.service}).
    
    The \vb machine needs to be started passing the option \texttt{proxy} to the configuration script \texttt{start\_vms.sh}.
    The executable powers up the necessary virtual machines (firewalls and domain controller) and configures the networks.

    \section{Test of the setup}
    The IP address \texttt{100.64.2.5/24} (belonging to the client network) was assigned to a virtual interface of the host and the route \texttt{100.64.0.0/16} was added to the same interface via \texttt{100.64.2.1} (the internal firewall's address in the client network).
    
    A \kat guest was created in the client network.
    When it tried to connect to a web server (either in the private network or in the internet) trough \textit{links}, no page could be reached.
    
    In the host OS, a Mozilla Firefox instance was configured to use \texttt{100.64.6.3} as web proxy.
    When it tried to connect to a web server, the proxy requested user credentials.
    It was possible to navigate only if the inserted username and password corresponded to a valid LDAP user account.
