    \section{Introduction}
    An intrusion prevention systems (IPS) is a device that monitors a network to identify malicious activities, log information about them, report them and attempt to block them.
    The IPS that comes with \opn is \suri, owned and supported by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), a non-profit foundation.
    
    In this laboratory, \suri is configured in both firewalls to block the majority of suspect or potentially undesired activities (such as the Tor protocol and connections to social networks) and auto-update itself.
